        First, I was worried in my first class, and it increased in the second class since they were saying things very speedily. The pressure was increased in my mind due to academics and short courses simultaneously. As days passed, the pressure in my mind decreased when I talked with my brother and parents. After that, I started to learn the contents of that course. But after 2 - 3 lectures they taught us normally without hurry. Finally, I knew it. Now, as an assignment, I am writing this blog post. </p>
